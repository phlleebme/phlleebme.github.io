                                        <p> I joined 2 different biomedical startups consecutively in a phase where the technologies were just tangible, but they wanted a better understanding of the market needs and existing services. I helped comb through scientific studies, as well as existing products and their patents to help discern market niches and the technical functionalities of said products.</p>
                                        <p class="toggle-text" id="toggle-text-5">  Both of these companies really helped me understand amorphous work, or projects that are very vague in their descriptions and inspire me to develop my own game plan of approach. The first company, Optofluidic Bioassay, was working on faster, more accurate ELISA testing and I worked to construct a narrative of the ELISA testing scene from users, service providers, testing labs, and product manufacturers to aid in their product development. The next company, Arborsense, looked to utilize graphene to develop wearable sensors due to the unique material properties of the material. </p>

                                        <p> One of my more pure life sciences focused endeavors, I linked with Dr. Danielle Kroetz, to help with her work on the genetic expressions of post-influenza bacterial pneumonia. It was here that I learned the value of extreme accuracy – solutions and measurements had to be measured to the microliter during the in-vivo and in-vitro studies I performed. </p>

                                            <li>The chords are going to hurt your fingers early on and feel extremely uncomfortable but practice making the hand positions everyday and it will become easier!</li>
                                            <li>Work on some of the essential chords (C, D, E, F, G, A) and you'll be well on your way to strumming along with some simple songs.</li>
                                            <li>A great way to practice is to repeat a chord but remove your hand from the neck in between each strum. This will reset the hand each time to help build the muscle memory</li>

                                                <li>For some languages that are not Latin script based, it never hurts to lay down some fundamental knowledge regarding the writing systems and general pronunciation.</li>
                                                <li>Not everyone (myself included) can afford to immerse themselves in another culture by living there. However, having friends that are fluent allows you to interact and learn from someone who can structure your learning experience more efficiently.</li>

                                                <li>As non-native speakers, one of the biggest traps to fall into is trying to <em>translate</em> everything into your native tongue. Language itself is rich in the culture and history of the people who speak it and you lose out on a lot of that value when you learn to only translate your thoughts, instead of expressing them in this new language.</li>
                                                <li>Although you need to learn through immersion, it is really easy to believe that you can learn by just watching/listening to a plethora of entertainment sources. Learning is an active experience so if you aren't doing anything like repeating words or trying to comprehend, you will never get anywhere!</li>
                                            </ul>

                                                <li>Whether your goal is maintaining an active lifestyle, losing weight, or putting on some muscle, the only way to see tangible results is to develop a smart routine that your body responds to and stick with it!</li>
                                                <li>I cannot stress the value of stretching and warming up when working out! Not only will it loosen up your muscles and avoid injuries, but you will actually be able to perform better after doing both.</li>
                                                <li>Structure your day to encourage your ability to go exercise. Don't plan to go exercise after an hour of TV or something else you enjoy or it will be hard to pull yourself away. Instead, "reward yourself" by not doing that fun activity until after working out. You'll be experiencing that endorphin rush AND that dopamine rush at the same time and look forward to doing it all over again the next day.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        <h3>Be Careful!</h3>
                                        <h4>Things to Keep an Eye on</h4>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Rest days are important! Don't get caught thinking that working out more will make you achieve your goal more quickly. While it may help a small amount, it also puts you at risk of injury and decreases your body's muscle recovery, which ultimately is what helps your develop that muscle mass.</li>
                                                <li>One of the biggest misconceptions is that putting time in the gym is all it takes to meet one's fitness goals. Unfortunately, diet is MUCH more important. Finding the balance to eat enough macronutrients to fuel your body, while maintaining your overall caloric intake to avoid excess weight gain is one of the biggest struggle for anyone trying to obtain a fitness goal.</li>

                                        <h3>Getting Started</h3>
                                        <h4>Read, read, and read!</h4>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>For a lot of people, finance just means paying bills, taxes, and retirement money. One of the biggest reasons is just the overwhelming amount of "stuff" that can be associated with being financially proactive. At the end of the day, most of it just boils down to 3 questions: How much should I spend, save, and invest?</li>
                                                <li>Spending - Without a solid gameplan, you will always end up overspending. Spend what you have after saving, not the other way around (Yes, I know, another W.B quote. The guy's smart!) Figure out your plan for saving first and then think about the fun stuff.</li>
                                                <li>Saving - Personally, I put away as much money as I can every month. I created a spreadsheet that I can update with my daily expenditures and it provides me with a sense of how much I can spend AFTER considering all the money I plan to spend. In the end, if I don't spend all the leftover money, it feels pretty nice throwing in some extra money in to the nest.</li>
                                                <li>Investing - Investing is honestly more of a subset for saving but it's such an expansive topic that I felt like it deserved it's own section. I like to think of finances as a fluid body - income and expenditures keep it moving and alive. Like water, when there's no movement, it can become stagnant. Sure the water's still there after a while but is it still as valuable as when it was fresh or if you had used it to water a plant? Long metaphor but you get what I mean!</li>
                                            </ul>

                                        <h4>Things to Keep an Eye on</h4>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Everyone's financial situation is different. Always remember your own circumstances and take inspiration, not instruction from basically anyone who doesn't handle finances for a living.</li>
                                                <li>Investing is a long term committment, and just like any other committment, there will always be a risk. If you aren't comfortable putting your savings into high risk, high reward options, make sure you're aware of some of the safer, more consistent asset classes such as bonds.</li>
                                                <li>In retrospect, something I've discovered is that while saving is important, don't become a Scrooge with your money. Enjoy what you can, when you can, and in the long run, it will be a better memory and experience than suffering while you're young and full of energy in order to have some more money when you're older.(Refer to Point 1)</li>

                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Photography is really about what you want to get out of it. There are some fundamentals you must understand first like aperture, shutter speed, and ISO. But beyond that, it's really just understanding what you are looking for in a photo and researching what aspects of the camera you need to control to achieve that end product.</li>
                                                <li>A few crucial tools are obviously a camera, a means to tweak your photos, and a community to give you feedback and support! There are always going to be people that started where you were and are doing what you want, so why not learn from them and skip the road bumps?</li>
                                                <li>Reframe your vision! The more you see, the more you experiment, and the more you think about different venues of expression, the more ways you'll be able to visualize and develop your own unique perception of the world and its portrayal!</li>
                                            </ul>

                                                <li>Cameras and the associated equipment can be expensive so it never hurts to start off with cheaper alternatives, whether it is the smartphone you already own, or older models. Once you develop an appreciation for the more technologically advanced aspects of the pricier cameras, you'll be able to utilize them all the more.</li>
                                                <li>In connection with the first point, the camera doesn't make the images, it's always the one who points it. There are some great photographers who can use a puddle on the ground to create a stunning image; the only limitation is your imagination!</li>
                                            </ul>

At the crux of it, there are 2 major categories: Imperative, where you tell the computer how to do something, and declarative, where you just tell the computer what to do.</li>
                                                <li>In terms of choosing a first language, it wil really depend on what kind of things you want to eventually work on, as well as how much effort you will be able to put in. Taken from an article on CrossBrowserTesting:

One thing that helped ease me into learning about web development was just establishing enough of a foundation to explore the things I didn't know. Work on small projects with a certain outcome in mind and you will come to know what concepts aren't as crucial, which ones you need to work on more, and which ones you need to do more learning for.</li>

                                                <li>If you're fresh to the programming scene, it is helpful to only focus on one language. While many of the differnt languages may share logic and functions, the syntax is usually slightly different and it is easy to get confused. Focus on one and then expand!</li>
                                                <li>It's extremely helpful to register a GitHub account. It helps host the "code" that you write and allows you to keep track of changes, as well as take a look at projects being worked on by different people. Once you find a firm footing, you can even contribute to those different projects yourself.</li>
